# Complete List of Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architecture Skills

[[toc]]

## Ability to Design for Business

### Business Use-Cases*
When it comes to designing a cloud for business use-cases, there are a few key considerations that need to be taken into account.
### Product Strategies*
Product strategies have a big impact on cloud architecture design.
### Go-live Strategies*
Cloud-based launches require careful planning to ensure a successful outcome.
### Application Design*
Applications that are designed to run in the cloud must be able to take advantage of the functionality, scalability and flexibility that the cloud offers. 
### Cost Considerations*
For every cost-effective option for running an application, there are at least two other cost-*ineffective* ways to accomplish the same thing in a cloud.
### Systems Integration
Key considerations for communicating between cloud and on-premises networks and applications.
### Data Handling and Management*
Keeping your data safe and secret is the goal of proper data handling, especially production and sensitive data.
### Compliance, Regulations, Access Restrictions*
Designing cloud architecture requires staying within industry compliance, legal regulation, and policy access restrictions. That involves careful consideration and arduous planning.
### Security
Trust no file, no connection, no application. Treat everything as untrusted as a potential layer of breach, act according to that and you'll be fine.
### Measures of Success
Does our proof of concept have any measures of success other than a successful healthcheck? It should. What else are we missing?
## Ability to Design Around Technical Needs
### Technical Debt Reconciliation
Technical debt is the amount of time and effort required to fix or improve software that is not up to date or is poorly designed. It can accumulate over time as a result of shortcuts taken during development, such as using quick and dirty solutions instead of taking the time to do things properly. 
### Availability
What to keep in mind when it comes to ensuring cloud availability.
### Scailing Resources
Ensuring that the scaling process is efficient and cost effective and elastic.
### Reliability Engineering
Working to identify and mitigate potential sources of failure.
## Ability to Design Compute Architecture
### Compute Engine
Google Compute Engine is a cloud computing service that provides virtual machines that run on Google infrastructure.
### Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed, production-ready environment for deploying containerized applications. 
### Anthos
A platform that enables runs containerized applications in hybrid or multi-cloud environment, whether they are deployed on-premises or in the cloud.
### Cloud Functions
Google Cloud Functions is a serverless computing platform that allows you to run code in the cloud without having to manage a server or cluster.
### Configuration
Handling Application configuration.
### Management
Considering infrastructure management tasks such as log rotation.
### States
Stateful applications, application states, statelessness.
### Data flows
Message queuing, bottlenecks and performance.
### Data Integrity
Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle.
### Monitoring and Alerting
Set up alerts and view monitoring data for your projects via dashboards.
## Ability to Design Storage Architecture
### Object Storage
Object storage is a type of storage that is well-suited for storing large amounts of data that is unstructured or semi-structured.
### Network Storage
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a managed network attached storage (NAS) service called Filestore and volumes attached to compute based services such as GKE.
### Databases
Knowledge of relational database creation, maintenance, backup, and related processes.
### Cloud SQL
Managed relational databases meet certain needs that compute database engines do not.
### Cloud Spanner
Google Cloud Spanner is a relational database service that offers global horizontal scaling, strong consistency, and high availability. Basically Managed Vitesse.
### Big Query
Google BigQuery is a cloud-based big data analytics web service for processing very large read-only data sets.
### Cloud Firestore*
Cloud Firestore is an auto-scaling document database for storing, syncing, and querying data for mobile and web apps.
### Bigtable
Google Big Table is a distributed storage system for low-latency access to large amounts(petabytes) of structured data.
### Data Retention and Lifecycles
As data doesn't need to be access as frequently, it can be time partitioned for cost-effective solutions.
### Latency Issues
Latency is a key consideration for accessing data in any kind of storage. Regional, zone, and CDN considerations must be made.
