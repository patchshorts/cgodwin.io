# Differences in Google Cloud Platform(GCP) Priemium Network Tiers

This is just a test page.

[[toc]]

## Premium Tier
This tier uses more resources to think out the best route. This tier has more
than 100 Points-of-Presence(PoP) which lets the packets leave Google's network
nearest to the customer. Packets use a more direct route a "cold potato"
algorythm. This Tier support global load balancers.

## Standard Tier
Using the "Hot Potato" method, the Standard Tier network tries rid itself of the
packet by sending it to the earliest responding route. This is a less direct
path and may not egrees through a PoP as near to the destination. This Teir can
only support Load Balancers which are regional.
